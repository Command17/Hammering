## About 📖

Hammering is a both Fabric and NeoForge mod and the successor to Hammered.

If you don't know Hammered, this mod basically adds hammers, that's it.

To be more specific:
- Iron Hammer
- Gold Hammer
- Diamond Hammer
- Netherite Hammer
- Hammering Enchantment

These hammers act like multi-tools (that means they're pickaxes, shovel, hoes and axes combined!)
which can mine up to a 3x3x3 area with enchantments!

## Showcase 🖼️
