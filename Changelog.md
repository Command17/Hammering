***Bumped version to 3.0.0***

I decided to switch back to **Architectury**. **EnchantedBookLib**, even though it was what I wanted,
took a lot of my time to update it and this mod. It was a pain to update to 1.21.4.
So for faster updating I switched back to **Architectury**.

Now requires **Forge Config API Port** on Fabric!

**Added:**
- New configs (thanks to **Forge Config API Port**!)
  - New server config
  - New startup config
- Support for **Enchantment Descriptions**

**Changed:**
- Renamed `gold_hammer` to `golden_hammer`
- The old config has been moved to a server config
- Hammer durability modifier is now changeable in the startup config
- Hammers creative tab is now toggleable in the startup config
